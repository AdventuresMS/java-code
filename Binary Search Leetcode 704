//Problem Statement
You are given a sorted array of unique integers, nums, and an integer target. Your task is to write a function that searches for target in nums.

If target is found, return its index.
If target is not found, return -1.
The solution must run in O(log n) time complexity.//




class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int lo = 0,hi = n-1;
        while(lo<=hi){
            int mid = lo+(hi-lo)/2;
            if(nums[mid]==target)return mid;
            if(target<nums[mid])hi = mid-1;
            else lo = mid+1;
        }
            return -1;

        }
       
    }
